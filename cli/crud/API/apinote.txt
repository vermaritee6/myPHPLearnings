												-:What is Api:-
												==============
Api stand for application programiing interface.
Api is a machanism by using which one typ applicationcan communicate ith another application.
in general Api is very  big topic.
Api are used different applicationt to data from one plateform to another plateform worldmeter.com corona virus Api.
Any application A,b,c can utilise the api of worldmeter.com to get live update of corona.

1.interOperability: Conversion  of one tye of language to some common language so data can be exchanged without 
directly converting the one language to another language .
interOperability refer to sharing of ,data from one application to another application without changing native language
,by means of some common interconversion language.

or
Sharing of data from one to another app without directly converting the native language is called interOperability.
for exam:-
Android ----->Json------>Java
python-------->Json------>Java
python-------->Json------>PHP
php---------->Json------>SQL

main feature of interOperability is plateform independent Nature.
php---(serializtion /Json Encoding  )------>Json--->(Deserializtion/Json Decode)->SQL
serializtion/Json Encoding:converting one type pl.to Json object
Deserializtion/Json Decode :converting Json type to one type of Data-type of pl.

Exam:-
php---json_encode()--->json (serializtion)
Associative Array ----->json



Json ---->json_dencode ()------>Associative Array .(De-serializtion)


what is web-service.
====================
Any type of service  acccess over the internet is termed as Web -service ,it can be any type  of service and 
can used any protocal.

what is web-Api.
========================
The api which can be access only via web interface or internet as   medium as  clled as Web-Api .
java Application -----------> oracl local db 
				localDrive Api
Game application----------> Sound Driver
				Audio Api
Every Web-Api is Api but not every Api is web-Api.
what is Soap.
========================
it is type of Web-Api which can be used , transport Data/represent the data ,in form SimpleObject Access protocal which
used XML DATA representation .
Eg:
====
<xml:nmps="version /xml-docment-4">
		<xml:Envelope>
			<Employee>
					<user id ="1">
						<email>riyaa$gmail.com</email>
						<password>11234</password>
					</user>
				</employee>
			</Envelope>
		</xml>
use for every heavy data transmission.		
soap is highly scalable
soap is secure ,why because yuo have access nth node for access real data node.
soap Architecher ca very very deep that itcan be very complax to handle.
what is RESET.
===============
Stand for representation state tranfer ,
it is type of Web-Api which work under http protocal it representation is always ,in json format 
it will very very light-weight ,
Easy to handle ,due to organised data structer in form of key and value paiers.

REST Api work on the bassis HTTP method:-
*******************************************
REQUEST:GET
REQUEST:POST
REQUEST:OPTION
REQUEST:PATCH
REQUEST:PUT 
REQUEST:DELETE
REQUEST:LOCK
REQUEST:HEAD
{
"type":"GET",
"version":"1..0.1",
"status":"true";
"error":false;
"code":200,
"data":[
{"emp":1001,"name":"riyaa","salary":10000},
{"emp":1002,"name":"priya","salary":30000},
{"emp":1003,"name":"ritu","salary":50000},

],
"keywords",[],
}

what is postman:-
=================
		Postman is a client  tool to sent the pure http  request to the server.and testing Api's.
		post man has set of http method to intersept the REST Api, by using GET,POST PATCH DELETE...etc. and also has
		different payloads which can e binded as header ,and body content .


what is different b/w RESET & soap:-
====================================
1.  Rest:representational state transfer
1.	Soap:simple object access protocal

2.	Rest:useslower bandwidth
2.	Soap:uses higher bandwidth

3.	Rest:it follows wb-standerds releted http protocal.
3.	Soap:its follows xml structuer and convetion, based on envelope and web standerds.

4.	Rest:lower sequrity
4.	Soap:higher sequrity

5.	Rest:easy to handle ,easy to deseriable and seriable .
5.	Soap:very defuclt to handle ,

6.	Rest:data reperastion is in jason ,yml.
6.	Soap:data reperastion is in xml.


Api Related Terms:-
=====================
				1.http method:these are set of method which re defind to perfom some unique opration
					In Rest Api
					http  method are equivalent DB opration
					
					C:creta the data Http/1.1 POST
					R:read the data HTTP/1.1 GET
					U:Update the data HTTP/1.1 PUT and PATCH 
						put :full update
						PATCH:partial update
					D:Delete the data HTTP/1.1 Delete
					HTTP has two version 1.1 and 2.1
					
					
				header: are type of payload (informaton )attached to request before data.
					header can contain informaton like:http satus :200,or 404,500
					header has contain informaton like:contain -type :text/html contin -type:application /json,contain 
					-type:image/jpeg all these are called mime types.
					header has allowed method :get,post,....
					header  can be used to check if request are authentic or not
					header can be used to enable cors policy (contain origin request sequrity policy)
					
	Body content:
	==============
			it refer to form data ,supplied from form , or any client like postman 
				tyype od body data 
				1.formdata:form
				2.urlencoded data
				3.www -encode data
				4.raw data:json
					
	how to make a Api :-
